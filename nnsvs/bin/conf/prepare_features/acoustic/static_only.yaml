# Vibrato mode (https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02776)
# 1) none -> no vibrato modeling
# 2) sine -> sine vibrato modeling. Two dim features are added (rate and extent)
# 3) diff -> diff-based vibrato modeling. One-dim differential F0 is added.
# NOTE: you must be careful about the dimension of the acoustic features.
# For example, if you use sine-based vibrato modeling (w/ dynamic features),
# you'd need to increase 2*num_windows for the `out_dim` of the acoustic model.
